# Galactic-Space-Craft-Control
This program should interpret commands from Earth and convert them into instructions that the spacecraft can understand. The spacecraft's navigation occurs in the galaxy using three-dimensional galactic coordinates: x for east or west position, y for north or south position, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane.
